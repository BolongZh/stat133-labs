> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Create a GitHub repository
> * Create a local Git repository
> * Practice adding, and committing changes to your (local) Git repo
> * Practice pushing committed changes to a remote repo


### General Instructions

- This lab involves 2 parts:
    1. GitHub workshop
    2. Git and GitHub Practice
- We assume that you have installed Git in your computer, and that you created a GitHub account.
- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code for the first two parts in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab06-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab06-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.

## Part 1) Git Workshop

The first part of the lab involves working on the workshop
[Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) 
by _Software Carpentry_, especifically parts 3 to 7 
(I'm assuming that you have Git installed in your machine).


### Introduce Yourself to Git

The first step involves introducing yourself to Git by running a couple of configuration commands. Basically, you need to tell Git who you are, and what your email is. Run the following commands using __your own user name__ and you __own email__.

```bash
# use your own user name
git config --global user.name "Gaston Sanchez"

# use your own email
git config --global user.email "gasigiri@berkeley.edu"

# colors
git config --global color.ui "auto"
```



### Your turn*

Write your bash commands inside one or more code chunks that are NOT evaluated. One way to do this is to add the option `eval = FALSE` inside the curly braces of the chunk (see image below)

2. [Setting Up Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/)
3. [Creating a Repository](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create/)
4. [Tracking Changes](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/)
5. [Exploring History](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/05-history/)
6. [Ignoring Things](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/)
7. [Remotes in GitHub](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/)

## Part 2) Git and GitHub Practice

The second part of the lab involves working on a baby project with Git.
Here are some resources that you may find useful:

- Chapters 1 __Getting Started__, and sections 2.1 to 2.5 in chapter 2 __Git Basics__, of the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

- [Github Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)


### Your Turn*: 1) Create a New GitHub Repository

- Open your browser and Sign in to your github account.
- Locate the `+` button (next to your avatar).
- Select the `New repository` option.
- Choose a name for your repository: e.g. `demo-repo`.
- In the __Description__ field add a brief description: e.g. "this is a demo repo"
- Use the default settings, and click the green button __Create repository__.
- You should see some content similar (but not identical) to the one below:

```bash
echo "# Demo Repo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/gastonstat/demo-repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Your Turn*: 2) Create a local Git Repository

- Open the terminal (Mac Terminal, or Git-Bash for Windows users).
- Optional: change directory to your preferred location
e.g. your `Desktop`
```bash
cd Desktop
```
- Create a directory with the name of your github repo
```bash
mkdir demo-repo
```
- Change to the directory you just created
```bash
cd demo-repo
```
- Initialize the directory as a git repository
```bash
git init
```

The command `git init` will set-up your directory `demo-repo` as a Git 
repository (NOT to confuse with your GitHub repository). This is basically
your __local__ repository.


_NOTE_: It's possible that you encounter some error message, e.g. Mac users may get a 
message related with a missing component for `CommandLineTools`. If this is your 
case, then type in the terminal console:

```bash
# Mac users may need to run this command
xcode-select --install
```



### Your Turn*: 3) Adding a README file

- It is customary to add a `README.md` file at the top level. This file must
contain (at least) a description of what the repository is about. The following
command will create a `README.md` file with some minimalist content:
```bash
echo "# Demo Repo" >> README.md
```
- So far you have a "new" file in your local repo, but this change has
not been recorded by Git. You can confirm this by checking the status of the repo:
```bash
git status
```
- Notice that Git knows that `README.md` is untracked. So let's add the 
changes to Git's database:
```bash
git add README.md
```
- Check the status of the repo again:
```bash
git status
```
- Now Git is tracking the file `README.md`.
- Next thing consists of __committing__ the changes. It's always a good practice to include a meaningful message for your commit.
```bash
git commit -m "first commit"
```

### Your Turn*: 4) Adding a remote

Right now you have a (local) Git repository in your computer. And you also have 
a (remote) GitHub repository in your GitHub account. Both repositories should have the 
same name, and the goal is to link them. To do this, you need to tell Git that 
a _remote_ repository (i.e. the one in GitHub) will be added:

- To add a remote repository use the command below __with your own username__:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git
```
- Verify your new remote
```bash
git remote -v
```
- If everything is okay, you should be able to see a message 
(with your own username) like this:
```
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git (push)
```

### Your Turn*: 5) Pushing changes to a remote repo

- Now that you have linked your local repo with your remote repo, you can 
start pushing (i.e. uploading) commits to GitHub.
- As part of the basic workflow with git and github, you want to constantly 
check the status of your repo
```
git status
```
- Now let's push your recent commit to the remote branch (`origin`) from
the local branch (`master`):
```bash
git push origin master
```
- Go to your Github repository and refresh the browser. If everything went fine, 
you should be able to see the contents of your customized `README.md` file.
- Keep modifying the content of `README.md` file, `add` the modifications to the git repository, display the `status`, `commit` the modifications, and `push` them to github repo.
